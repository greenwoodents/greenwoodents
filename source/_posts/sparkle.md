<div id="description" class="description">
Design 3 pages in Sparkle
_A unique work inquiry. We are always thrilled with new wysiwyg editor, but never have time to try them. In this case we were paid for it. Biggest advantage is speed. Iâ€™ve designed 3 one-page sites in 10 hours. It was smooth, but avoid having 40+ objects on one page._
