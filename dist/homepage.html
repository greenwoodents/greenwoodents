Because of this most websites are made in haste without looking on consequences like poor perfomance or mobile inefficiency. Thanks to the years of experience building websites, for clients or on our own, we know about each detail of the process as same as every ent knows about each tree in his forest.</p><h3 class="has-divider">There is that one thing that treebeard kept saying…</h3><h2 class="is-quote">don’t be hasty</h2><p class="classy-divider">&</p><p class="mr-b">There is time to sleep, time to eat and time to work. Plus we need to save some of our time for others. Do not forget it. It is not about how much money do you make or how many extra hours do you work today. Be responsible and think. Before you act.</p><h3 class="has-divider">…and he shared his knowledge</h3><h2 class="is-quote">so others do not need to reinvent the wheel</h2><p class="classy-divider">&</p><p>And that is why we started the moot, a place where we share our resources, workflow and ideas. So if you like the idea of being an ent or you are only interested in learning our know how, you may join us.</p><p><i>“Give, and it will be given to you.
